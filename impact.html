                    <h1>Impact Advisor</h1>
                    <p>In this group project, we set out to design a tool that would measure the environmental impact of a given website, using data fetched from both the <a href="https://api.websitecarbon.com/">Website Carbon</a> and
                        <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/">PageSpeed</a> API's. The final solution would collect the results in a database and compare results within a site's relevant industry.
                    </p>
                    <a href="https://wondrous-cocada-d788a0.netlify.app/" class="arrow_link">See our solution here &#x2794;</a>
                    <p class="note">*note: due to the instability of the Website Carbon API, the solution is temporarily de-coupled from the API. Just click 'create report' instead of inputting a URL.</p>

                    <p>Our goal was to create a streamlined solution that would encourage conversations about reducing the impact of individual websites by providing relevant information in an easily understandable, digestible format. The user inputs a URL
                        and selects the relevant industry, submits the form, and then the rest of the page containing the results is displayed. The tool allows the users to adjust certain parameters and re-calculates the impact of the website to provide
                        the users with some options for improvements that would be realistic to implement. </p>

                    <p>In this project, I took the opportunity to take exclusive ownership of the visual design, in addition to some of the coding. I chose to work with a mostly dark palette to minimize energy consumption, and to code the animations purely
                        in CSS to keep the page lightweight. I tried to create something with a clear division of information, so the user could easily understand what each section was about.</p>

                    <p>This solution was also created in response to existing solutions, none of which we found to be 100% satisfactory. Many showed either too much data or not enough, were visually unappealing, and didn't allow for adjustable parameters,
                        all of which we tried to avoid address in our solution. In a future iteration we would provide a bit more text to give context, along with a 'read more' option on all the measurements and parameters to give the user more information.
