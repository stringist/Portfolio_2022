            <h1>The Party Devil Pre-game Game</h1>
            <p>Party Devil's not a bad guy; he's just looking for a good time! To pre-game is to get the party started before the party's even started; one of PD's specialties. In this rock n' roll-inspired javascript game, the player clicks on certain objects
                to gain points and up the festive spirit.
            </p>
            <!-- <p>This first-semester project was our first proper introduction to JavaScript, as well as CSS animations. I was determined to create something with a sense of motion and hopefully also a sense of humor. It was a very challenging project with
                the limited amount of knowledge I had at the time, but also very instructive and rewarding. </p> -->

            <p>The game as a whole was very inspired from my own background in and around the punk and metal music scenes, and I wanted to take the opportunity to create a soundtrack that reflected that. All of the sounds effects are recorded on guitar,
                as well as the background music itself, which was heavily inspired by NPR, a local punk band from my hometown of Waco, TX. </p>
