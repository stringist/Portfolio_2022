                <h1>The Party Devil Pre-game Game</h1>
                <p>
                    Party Devil's not a bad guy; he's just looking for a good time! To pre-game is to get the party started before the party's even started; one of PD's specialties. In this rock n' roll-inspired javascript game, the player clicks on certain objects to gain
                    points and up the festive spirit.

                    This first-semester project was our first proper introduction to JavaScript and CSS animations. We learned a variety of new concepts, inculding if-statements, classList and eventListener, iterating, and activity diagrams. We were required to create all
                    visual and audio elements ourselves, which was a challenge I found very enjoyable.

                    I wanted to create a game that was visually appealing and hopefully a bit humorous. I designed the characters in an exaggeratedly 'cute' style to underline the light-heartedness I was trying to convey.
                </p>
                <p>In the course of this project, I discovered that I really enjoyed animating through code, and found I was deeply fascinated with the creative and expressive potentials of animation on the web, both within and beyond the context of a game.</p>

                    The game as a whole was very much inspired from my own background coming of age in the punk and metal music scenes, and I wanted to take the opportunity to create a soundtrack that reflected that. All of the sound effects are recorded on guitar, as well
                    as the background music itself. Soundtrack below:
