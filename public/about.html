                    <p>I am a multidisciplinary creative and aspiring front-end developer with a fine arts background, currently studying Multimedia Design at KEA in Copenhagen.

                        <p>Some of the areas covered so far at KEA have been UI design and development, UX, content creation, and technology and business. In the course of my studies, I discovered a new passion in front-end development, which has only been
                            re-affirmed by taking the front-end elective. Following this, I am now seeking an internship in this field, and dreaming of a future position where I can pursue hands-on web programming while still being able to draw upon and
                            utilize my visual arts background. I am especially interested in developing my abilities in animating with JavaScript, and in exploring the expressive potentials of using animations to bring pages to life.</p>
                        <p> Outside of studying at KEA, I have been working professionally as a glassblower for the past 10 years in a variety of settings, from private studios to factory work, as well as teaching. As a result of these experiences, I deeply
                            value quality craftsmanship and good teamwork, and have developed a borderline unhealthy attention to detail. When not blowing glass or studying, I can usually be found playing thrash metal with my band Terminalist, either
                            at our practice space in NÃ¸rrebro or at various venues around Denmark.</p>
